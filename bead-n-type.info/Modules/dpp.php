                    <h3>CSS Exercises</h3>
                    <p>This week I worked on my main CSS formatting and some more page content. I used the CSS directions from the lesson and applied my colors from my Site Plan. 
                    I thought I was getting it done right but I can't get the navigation bar and footer to look right now. I think the main.css is conflicting with the navigation, header and footer
                    css. In addition to this I got content onto my shop page with an Etsy widget. </p>

                    <h3>CSS Exercises</h3>
                    <p>I spent my time this week working on getting my navigation bar, it's CSS page and other CSS pages formatted more correctly.
                    I found directions for a horizontal navigation bar and followed it. I am not entirely thrilled with the outcome though. The 
                    sections that have a drop down are also different in height. I suppose I could add a drop-down portion to each of the options to
                    make it consistent but I'd rather fix the issue without having to do that. 
                    
                    While I was working the navigation CSS, which is linked in the header's CSS, I did a lot of hopping back and forth. Making sure I was
                    using containers and such. I still have a lot more to do to meet the rubric but I feel like I can get there if I can get some good CSS 
                    pages.</p>

                    <h3>CSS Exercises</h3>
                    <p>I was glad to work on the CSS exercises this week. Although I got some exposure to them last semester, I really feel like I got a great deal out of them.
                    I am sure I will be able to implement these lessons onto my website. Columns especially. Now to get going on it. It's hard to know where to start. What do I do first?
                    I am really looking forward to implementing the same layout on most pages though. That has to make things a lot simpler.</p>

                    <p>This week I've been searching my archives looking for a suitable video for my website. I haven't felt right about using
                    a random video from YouTube, not wanting to violate copyright. The video I created last semester for Foundations English on 
                    creativity would not load sound. The video that was taken of me at a recent event by a BYU-I Communications student has yet
                    to be loaded to their site. All in all, I feel like I've wasted a lot of time.</p>

                    <h3>Troubleshooting and Google Analytics</h3>
                    <p>I've been having a lot of difficulty this past week and a half trying to figure out what I did to make my page quit working.
                    In the process of adding audio, Google Analytics, a contact form and my pages, I entered something somewhere that kept my page
                    from loading correctly. I've spent the main portion of my time this week on analyzing each step. Each space and character.
                    I had to take my mind off it and get other work done. So, in the mean time, I made sure I had the pages laid out, and the
                    corresponding navigation to each. Going back over things again, I decided to remove the PHP code reference for Google Analytics
                    to see if that was where my error was since I had gone over everything else. With it removed, my site loaded. With visibility
                    back, I went to check my contact form and see if the code I entered worked. I have the form showing and entry works although I 
                    am not happy with the placement of the Captcha. There is a problem with the javaScript however. When I press Send, the result 
                    seeing the javaScript on the screen. Not sure how to fix this one. I know my site is not where it should be by now. I am missing
                    some elements but am able to breathe a little better knowing it will at least run now. </p>

                    <h3>First 3 hours</h3>
                        <p>This week I started with getting my footer including the Deliberate Practice Plan, Site Plan and DB Journal up to par. 
                        This entailed going back to the rubric and examples for the DB plan and journal. For the site plan I brought the PDF 
                        and JPG files into Netbeans and updated the site plan from an HTML to a PHP file. This first session was necessary if 
                        I am to continue to get my feet under me and make continuous positive progress in this course.</p>
                    <h3>Last 2 hours</h3>
                        <p>The second time I worked on my website was to get the header and navigation menu modularized. Before I got started a 
                        whipped up a logo of sorts for the header. As I was working through centering, I read that the align center command 
                        is not supported on HTML5 and that I should add this option to CSS. This brought me to a stop, as I couldn't decide 
                        if the CSS link should be in the PHP page for each module or on the main index page. I tried both and for now will 
                        keep it on the main page. I will need to do some more work on that. I made sure the "Home" link worked in the 
                        navigation though. To get going on my CSS page, I grabbed my code from last semester's work since most of it was for 
                        the navigation menu. Since the outcome is not the same, I am sure it has something to do with the PHP file.</p>
                        <p>I feel that I have made great strides in cleaning up and catching up on my website. Here it is 9:22 on a Saturday night
                        and instead of being over-the-top stressed out and in tears, I am calm and relaxed and looking forward to turning in my
                        assignment. This has been a good week.</p>

                        <p>This week I studied "modulation" and understand the concept.It's a lot like CSS in that the code resides in it's own file. I like how this gives me the capability to have identical information throughout my website.
                        <p>Part of the problem I've been having getting my feet under me is going from Note++ to Netbeans to Go Daddy. I am so very frustrated. I have some information in each place and of course, none of it speaking to each other of course.
                        <p>This week has had me in tears. I did well in last semester's web design class. It was a breeze. This semester I feel like I am floundering and I know that I know how do the work. The problem is trying to figure out what I am working with.
                        <p>I have spent 4 hours this week, most of it in frustration.</p>

                        Are these actual typewriter keys? 
                        I have large wrists, can I have something custom sized?
                        Do you ship worldwide?
                        Where do you sell your designs? 
                        Do you offer wholesale pricing?

                        Do you make each item yourself or do you have a team that makes your designs?
                        What does “Artisan lampwork glass” mean? How is this different from other glass?
                        How do I care for my jewelry?
                        Can I have it gift boxed?
                        Can I order for my bridal party?</p>

                        <p>I am short a few sketches this week. My site plan doesn't seem to as elaborate as others. I should have a "back" link or something. I don't know what else I can do before the deadline. The information on the color and type was great this week and I appreciated the refresher. As for uploading pages to my website, I am still learning and have a long ways to go. I spend over 10 hours this week on the readings and putting together my site plan. One thing I tried to be sure about was to save examples from the lesson either in my class folder or as bookmarks. </p>
