                    <h1 text color='d86717'>What is the Prison to Prison Triathlon?</h1>
                  
                    <p>More than a loop around the city, this triathlon is a wonderfully challenging way to experience the natural beauties that surround San Francisco bay while taking in some historical sites of the area. Athletes will traverse the rich history in a way no others will.</p>
                    <p>Starting at San Quentin State Penitentary</p>                    
                    <img class="displayed" src="/triathlon/images/sanquentin.jpg" alt="san quentin" title="San Quentin" width='600'>
                    <p><strong>San Quentin</strong> has a an interesting history as the first prison in California, spurred on by the gold rush at Sutter's Mill 1848 which brought a new population to the state, including many unsavory people. The construction of the prison, on prime real estate overlooking the San Francisco bay began in 1852 and was completed in 1854. Although opinions on the 150 year old prison's future, are varied, many agree that the time has come to close it down. Many would like to see the 20 acres of land developed into housing. Some would rather see the prison turned into a historic site, keeping it untouchable by developers.</p>
                  
                    <p>Triathletes will run about 16 miles up to Fisherman's Wharf along a scenic byway with the lapping waters on the west and the bluffs on the right.</p>
                    <p>From Fisherman's Wharf athletes will take of their running shoes and dive into a 3 mile swim to Alcatraz Island and back.</p>

                    <p>This is not for the faint of heart. San Francisco bay is frigidly cold, typically between 54 and 60 degrees. Athletes will need to be in top shape and appropriately dressed. Swimmers will be monitored by event staff and paramedics in boats and kayaks. Experts advise those with heart conditions should not participate in this leg. Participants should be endurance swimmers, able to keep their mental focus on their swimming and navigation, rather than the cold temperature. </p>

                    <p><strong>Alcatraz</strong> is among the more infamous of all prisons. Built to be impossible to escape. A statement that would of course become a challenge to prove them wrong.</p>
                   
                    
                    <p>Alcatraz Island, nicknamed "The Rock" before the prison was completed in 1934. Alcatraz penitentiary housed hardened, desperate criminals for nearly 30 years. Alcatraz Island is also home to the Pacific Coast's first lighthouse, in service for almost 125 years, guiding ships and offering protection. Today there are a variety of tours and activities on the island. Adventurous and brave souls can spend the night in the pitch black of the bleak cells and find out for themselves if the myth surrounding the prison being haunted is true.</p>

                    <p>After the trying swim, arriving back at Fisherman's Wharf, the final leg begins on bike. A scenic ride around San Francisco bay, crossing the John T. Knox freeway.</p>
                    <img class="displayed" src="/triathlon/images/bikes.jpg" alt="cyclists" title="Cyclists" width='600'>
                   <p>The <strong>John T. Knox Freeway</strong> bridges over the bay with a beautiful view of Mount Tamalpais to the South. Remnants of the old ferry dock are still visible at the beginning of the bridge to the north. Strong crosswinds, reaching at rare times to 70 mph, have been known to close the bridge, leaving commuters wishing there were still the option of a ferry to get them over to San Rafael. Cyclists will push their endurance as they traverse the bridge, returning to the beginning of the race at San Quentin State Prison.</p>
