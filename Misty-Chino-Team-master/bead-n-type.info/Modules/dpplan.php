    <h4>Where</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally I do my best work when I am isolated and without interruption or distraction. The best places for me are either in my bedroom, camped out with a beverage and snacks. Or sitting on the sofa in the living room, with the television off. </p>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>When</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With everything that is dividing my schedule into tiny fragments of time, slicing out a designated time isn’t easily achieved. However, there are times during the week, when I can be left to study. The prime time is on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, between noon and 3 p.m. when my children are still at school and my morning commitments have been met. Other times are captured here and there; Tuesday and Thursday evenings, Saturday afternoons. But to schedule a time for deliberate practice, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays are the best.</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>How</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I can spend one solid, uninterrupted hour a day completely focused. I will be able to show more progress than that same work done during an evening of distractions from family and devices. Extending that hour, when possible, to two hours would prove even more beneficial and productive. Using the momentum established during the initial hour to swing into the second hour.</p>
<p>The key to making the most of these hours is preparation. Reading the assignment, getting all my “ducks in a row” before I try to launch into a project. By preparing ahead of time, I can keep that focus on the task without leaving it to find out more information or gather other details that should have been gathered as part of the preparation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Who</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My husband will be my main go-to-guy for determining the quality of my work and whether or not I am mastering the principle I am working on. He is technical in the hardware sense, in network and troubleshooting. For web design his knowledge is somewhat on the same level as mine is. I can explain to him what I am doing, how I have tried to achieve it, and together we can see if I am missing the mark and if so, figure out where.</p>
