              <h2>Who I Am</h2>
              <img src="pics/Icon-Misty3.jpg" title="Misty image">
             <p> I am a creative person. I see things that might be. I think of other ways of
            of doing things. The "what ifs". During different periods in my life one thing
            or another would be my hobby, my creative outlet. Since I started designing
            jewelry in around 2005, I feel that I found my niche. I'm a fanatic about beads,
            specifically artisan crafted lampwork glass beads. I am also intrigued by making
            jewelry out of found things, mainly antique typewriter keys but so much more than
            that; game pieces, ephemera, hardware, you name it. 

        <p> My background is in Drafting and Design. My degree is from The Art Institute 
            of Seattle in Interior Design. I worked as a drafter for a few years in 
            Western Washington then was relocated to Southern Idaho in 2000 when I got married. 
            Drafting is not very female-friendly in these parts so I turned to more creative 
            things. 

        <p> In 2005 beading took hold. I'd done the occasional beady project but for some reason 
            at that time it took over and all my other creative outlets have taken the farthest 
            back seat. My scrap booking, crocheting and sewing machine have never been more lonely!

        <p> I started lampworking in 2006 and love it! Unfortunately I had to put that on 
            hold until I could remedy my Carpal Tunnel issue.  

        <p> Until then, and after I'm sure, I am a huge fan of lampwork beads and love to use 
            them as the focal and catalyst of my designs. I love that each one is a unique tiny 
            work of art. I treat them as small works of art, framing each one in a one of a kind
            design.
            
        <p> I've learned a lot in these last years, nearly a decade. couple years. A huge part of
            that learning has come from my association with various bead groups but in particular 
            my friends at the Bead Hive. The exchanges, challenges and tutorials have expanded my
            knowledge and techniques. 

        <p> I dabble in all sorts of things. I particularly love to create new things with found 
            objects. Especially making jewelry with unusual objects such as dominoes, buttons, 
            legos, typewriter keys, etc...

        <p> I hope you enjoy my creations!</p>
